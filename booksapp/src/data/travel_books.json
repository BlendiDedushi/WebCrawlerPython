Bedford definitely did a few things her mother might classify as \"stupid.\" She swam with great white sharks in South Africa, ran from lions in Zimbabwe, climbed a Himalayan mountain without training in Nepal, and watched as her friend was attacked by a monkey in Indonesia.But interspersed in those slightly more crazy moments, Sue Bedfored and her friend \"Sara the Stoic\" experienced the sights, sounds, life, and culture of fifteen countries. Joined along the way by a few friends and their aging fathers here and there, Sue and Sara experience the trip of a lifetime. They fall in love with the world, cultivate an appreciation for home, and discover who, or what, they want to become.It's Only the Himalayas is the incredibly funny, sometimes outlandish, always entertaining confession of a young backpacker that will inspire you to take your own adventure. ...more",

For millennia this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ark following the Great Flood. But it also plays a significant role in the longstanding conflict between Turkey and Armenia.Author Rick Antonson joined a five-member expedition to the mountain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly 17,000-foot summit, trekking alongside a contingent of Armenians, for whom Mount Ararat is the stolen symbol of their country. Antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote with unexpected travel vignettes, whether tracing earlier mountaineering attempts on the peak, recounting the genocide of Armenians and its unresolved debate, or depicting the Kurds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ambitions for their own nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borders, which some say should include Mount Ararat.What unfolds in Full Moon Over Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ark is one man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s odyssey, a tale told through many stories. Starting with the flooding of the Black Sea in 5600 BCE, through to the Epic of Gilgamesh and the contrasting narratives of the Great Flood known to followers of the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions, Full Moon Over Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ark takes readers along with Antonson through the shadows and broad landscapes of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Armenia, shedding light on a troubled but fascinating area of the world. ...more",
